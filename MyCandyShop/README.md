## My Candy Shop

Welcome to My Candy Shop, an online store where you can buy your favorite candies and chocolates. This app serves both vendors and customers, allowing them to sell and purchase items easily. Currently, the focus is on chocolates and candies, but the selection can expand to include any desired items in the future.

### Data Format and Administration

The app utilizes an array format to display items. This means that administrators can easily add new products by simply updating this array. In the future, I plan to implement an Admin Panel that will allow admins to add items directly without needing to access the code.

### Using the App

Interacting with MyCandyShop is straightforward and user-friendly:

- **Viewing Items**: Upon opening the app, users will see a list of chocolates available for purchase.
- **Adding to Cart**: Each item will have an 'Add to Cart' button. Clicking this button will add the selected chocolate to the user's shopping cart.
- **Managing Cart**: Users can scroll down to view their items in the cart. Here, they can update the quantity of each item or remove items entirely from the cart.
